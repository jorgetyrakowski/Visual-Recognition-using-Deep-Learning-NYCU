## 🧠 Course Description

Computer vision aims to empower computers with the ability to “see” — to perceive, understand, and interpret the visual world. Deep learning has emerged as the backbone of modern computer vision, enabling systems to achieve remarkable performance in visual tasks.

This course covers:

- Key deep learning architectures (DNNs, CNNs, Transformers, GANs, Diffusion Models)
- Core computer vision applications:  
  - Object recognition & detection  
  - Segmentation  
  - Image restoration  
  - Low-level & 3D vision  
- Hands-on assignments and a final project
